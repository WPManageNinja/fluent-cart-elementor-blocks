Elementor Blocks for FluentCart lets you build checkout flows, cart interactions, and product layouts visually in Elementor while using FluentCart’s native commerce logic and assets.

== Description ==
Elementor Blocks for FluentCart is the add-on you need to design FluentCart checkout, cart, and product experiences directly inside Elementor without relying on theme templates or custom code.
If you are using FluentCart and Elementor and want full control over checkout layouts, add-to-cart actions, mini cart placement, product carousels, category lists, or full shop archives, this add-on provides purpose-built Elementor widgets that render FluentCart’s native output.
All widgets load FluentCart’s required CSS and JavaScript assets automatically and remain fully compatible with FluentCart products, variations, subscriptions, coupons, order bumps, taxes, and payment flows.
This add-on focuses on layout and styling control in Elementor while FluentCart continues to handle cart state, pricing rules, and checkout processing.
